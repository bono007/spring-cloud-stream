== Docker Compose scripts for Kafka

=== Kafka Cluster
Runs a multi-node Kafka cluster w/ 3 brokers available at `locahost:9091,localhost:9092,localhost:9093`.

To start the brokers run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml up
----
To stop the brokers run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml down
----

TIP: To start the containers in the foreground simply add `-d` to the start command. To stop containers that are running in the foreground simple issue `CTRL-C` command.


=== Control Center UI
Runs a https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/index.html[Confluent Control Center] that exposes a UI at http://locahost:9021.

NOTE: The scripts must be chained together as the UI depends on the brokers

To start the brokers and the Control Center UI run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml up
----
To stop the brokers and the Control Center UI run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml down
----

=== Schema Registry
Runs a https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html[Confluent Schema Registry] available at http://locahost:8081.

NOTE: The scripts must be chained together as the schema registry depends on the brokers

To start the brokers and the schema registry run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml up
----
To stop the brokers and the schema registry run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml down
----

=== All The Things
The scripts can be chained together to start the cluster, UI and schema registry with the following commmand:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml up
----
Likewise, to stop all the things:
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml down
----

TIP: The only "UI" representation of the schema registry is by navigating to a `Topic` and then clicking the `Schema` tab for the topic
